    <h3>ABOUT THE BOOK:</h3>
    <h5>[A profoundly moving story of family, secrets, and longing,
        Everything I Never Told You is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait,
        uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another.]</h5>
    <h3>Why I Love It:</h3>
    <h5>This book is a fantastic character portrait. I don't read these kinds of stories too often - family dramas with a focus on the everyday - but when I do I'm usually pleasantly surprised. As much as I'm a lover of amazing story arcs with problems and terrifying consequences, there really is something so fascinating about... people.
